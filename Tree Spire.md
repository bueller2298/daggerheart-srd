# Description
A massive overgrown tree that's very presence defies the capabilities of the soil it sits on. Travelers that stand within it's ever present shadow feel their lungs swollen with rich and clean air. During weeks of daylight Tree Spire is a beacon of refuge and hope, but as night approaches much of the wildlife vacate for the tree amplifies the darkness around it, blocking out all star light. Predators of darkness run rampant and seemingly come from above and below.
