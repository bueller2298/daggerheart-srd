## Inciting Incident
The [[Reaping Eye]] is stowed in a secure vault beneath the  central tower of [[Haven]]’s wizarding school, seemingly  impossible to recover. A secretive and dangerous rebel group,  led by a mysterious figure known only as the [[Fanewraith]] (she/her), has hatched a plan to end the curse of the  [[Witherwild]]: find [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|the Great Owl]], [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Nikta]], and pluck out the [[Sowing Eye]]. While this may solve the immediate problem,  the long-term consequences are not being considered, just  as they weren’t when [[Haven]] invaded.  [[Haven]]’s beleaguered spymaster, [[Kreil Dirn]] (he/him), is not  a popular person in [[Haven]]. He is responsible for rooting out  insurgents, stopping schemes before they have a chance to  start, and keeping a close watch on [[Haven]]’s internal activities.  [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] has never agreed—at least not openly—with [[Archmage Phylax]]’s (they/them) decision to steal the [[Reaping Eye]], and  the consequences they’ve all paid for that decision have been  grimly vindicating.  Recently, [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] uncovered the [[Fanewraith]]’s plot and is horrified  by the possibility of her success. Knowing he can’t send a  troop of [[Haven]] soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and  stop the [[Fanewraith]] from stealing the [[Sowing Eye]], [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] uses  his vast network of informants and spies to find a group of  adventurers who can bring the [[Fanewraith]] to swift justice.  The party is sent an invitation from [[Haven]] to meet with [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]]. But is his information correct? Does he have his own  motivation or secret ambition? Whether they come from  [[Fanewick]] or [[Haven]], the party must extend some trust to a  person who is equally as dangerous and mercurial as the  “enemy” they pursue. And what will they do when they find the  [[Fanewraith]]? Bring her to justice? Side with her? Attempt to  recover the [[Reaping Eye]]?  [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] advises the party to start their hunt for the [[Fanewraith]]  in the treetop village of [[Alula]], where he suspects she runs her operation.



"Silence the bells, for their ring is a lie. The seasons are broken. The world is coming undone.

Listen closely, and you will hear a faint hum—the thrum of **Fanewick's** unending life. For centuries, this untamed land has kept its secrets in the dark, twisted woods, guarded by ancient rules and the strange, small miracles of **Faint Divinities**. The people here, the **Wicklings**, have always been hardy, living by a single truth: the wilderness is a living thing, and you must respect its hunger.

But the world outside has changed.

In the walled city of **Haven**, the walls themselves are a tomb. Built from the petrified remains of **Shun’Aush, the Granite Ophid**, they were meant to be a monument to a godless empire. For a thousand years, they stood as a shield. But the ancient dust of that slain deity has found its way home.

It rose on the wind and settled in the lungs of **Haven's** people, a curse known as the **Serpent’s Sickness**. It starts with a cough of fine dust and ends with a scream, turning flesh to stone and leaving a city of silent statues.

In their desperation, the **Havenites** plunged into **Fanewick** in search of a cure: a single, rare bloom known as the **crimson lady’s veil**. But to find a cure, they brought a disease of their own. Under the command of **Archmage Phylax**, they did the unthinkable. They stole the **Reaping Eye** from **Nikta**, the Great Owl and Shepherd of the Seasons.

And in that moment, the balance broke.

Now, **Nikta** can only watch over the land with a single, unblinking **Sowing Eye**. The cycle of growth and decay is gone. The world is stuck in a state of eternal spring.

You can feel it in the air, a sticky warmth that never fades. The vines of the **Witherwild** choke the paths and strangle the rivers. The trees twist and coil into monstrous hunters. The very earth you walk on has become a hungry, verdant thing, swallowing everything in its path.

The walls of **Haven** may have kept out the gods, but they could not stop the vengeance of a broken land. And now, at the border of this eternal spring, your story begins."
