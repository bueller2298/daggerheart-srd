## Inciting Incident
The [[Reaping Eye]] is stowed in a secure vault beneath the  central tower of [[Haven]]’s wizarding school, seemingly  impossible to recover. A secretive and dangerous rebel group,  led by a mysterious figure known only as the [[Fanewraith]] (she/her), has hatched a plan to end the curse of the  [[Witherwild]]: find [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|the Great Owl]], [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Nikta]], and pluck out the [[Sowing Eye]]. While this may solve the immediate problem,  the long-term consequences are not being considered, just  as they weren’t when [[Haven]] invaded.  [[Haven]]’s beleaguered spymaster, [[Kreil Dirn]] (he/him), is not  a popular person in [[Haven]]. He is responsible for rooting out  insurgents, stopping schemes before they have a chance to  start, and keeping a close watch on [[Haven]]’s internal activities.  [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] has never agreed—at least not openly—with [[Archmage Phylax]]’s (they/them) decision to steal the [[Reaping Eye]], and  the consequences they’ve all paid for that decision have been  grimly vindicating.  Recently, [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] uncovered the [[Fanewraith]]’s plot and is horrified  by the possibility of her success. Knowing he can’t send a  troop of [[Haven]] soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and  stop the [[Fanewraith]] from stealing the [[Sowing Eye]], [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] uses  his vast network of informants and spies to find a group of  adventurers who can bring the [[Fanewraith]] to swift justice.  The party is sent an invitation from [[Haven]] to meet with [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]]. But is his information correct? Does he have his own  motivation or secret ambition? Whether they come from  [[Fanewick]] or [[Haven]], the party must extend some trust to a  person who is equally as dangerous and mercurial as the  “enemy” they pursue. And what will they do when they find the  [[Fanewraith]]? Bring her to justice? Side with her? Attempt to  recover the [[Reaping Eye]]?  [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] advises the party to start their hunt for the [[Fanewraith]]  in the treetop village of [[Alula]], where he suspects she runs her operation.
