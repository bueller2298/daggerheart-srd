## Inciting Incident
The [[Reaping Eye]] is stowed in a secure vault beneath the  central tower of [[Haven]]’s wizarding school, seemingly  impossible to recover. A secretive and dangerous rebel group,  led by a mysterious figure known only as the [[Fanewraith]] (she/her), has hatched a plan to end the curse of the  [[Witherwild]]: find [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|the Great Owl]], [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Nikta]], and pluck out the [[Sowing Eye]]. While this may solve the immediate problem,  the long-term consequences are not being considered, just  as they weren’t when [[Haven]] invaded.  [[Haven]]’s beleaguered spymaster, [[Kreil Dirn]] (he/him), is not  a popular person in [[Haven]]. He is responsible for rooting out  insurgents, stopping schemes before they have a chance to  start, and keeping a close watch on [[Haven]]’s internal activities.  [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] has never agreed—at least not openly—with [[Archmage Phylax]]’s (they/them) decision to steal the [[Reaping Eye]], and  the consequences they’ve all paid for that decision have been  grimly vindicating.  Recently, [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] uncovered the [[Fanewraith]]’s plot and is horrified  by the possibility of her success. Knowing he can’t send a  troop of [[Haven]] soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and  stop the [[Fanewraith]] from stealing the [[Sowing Eye]], [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] uses  his vast network of informants and spies to find a group of  adventurers who can bring the [[Fanewraith]] to swift justice.  The party is sent an invitation from [[Haven]] to meet with [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]]. But is his information correct? Does he have his own  motivation or secret ambition? Whether they come from  [[Fanewick]] or [[Haven]], the party must extend some trust to a  person who is equally as dangerous and mercurial as the  “enemy” they pursue. And what will they do when they find the  [[Fanewraith]]? Bring her to justice? Side with her? Attempt to  recover the [[Reaping Eye]]?  [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] advises the party to start their hunt for the [[Fanewraith]]  in the treetop village of [[Alula]], where he suspects she runs her operation.



"Silence the bells, for their ring is a lie. The seasons are broken. The world is coming undone.

Listen closely, and you will hear a faint hum—the thrum of **Fanewick's** unending life. For centuries, this untamed land has kept its secrets in the dark, twisted woods, guarded by ancient rules and the strange, small miracles of **Faint Divinities**. The people here, the **Wicklings**, have always been hardy, living by a single truth: the wilderness is a living thing, and you must respect its hunger.

But the world outside has changed.

In the walled city of **Haven**, the walls themselves are a tomb. Built from the petrified remains of **Shun’Aush, the Granite Ophid**, they were meant to be a monument to a godless empire. For a thousand years, they stood as a shield. But the ancient dust of that slain deity has found its way home.

It rose on the wind and settled in the lungs of **Haven's** people, a curse known as the **Serpent’s Sickness**. It starts with a cough of fine dust and ends with a scream, turning flesh to stone and leaving a city of silent statues.

In their desperation, the **Havenites** plunged into **Fanewick** in search of a cure: a single, rare bloom known as the **crimson lady’s veil**. But to find a cure, they brought a disease of their own. Under the command of **Archmage Phylax**, they did the unthinkable. They stole the **Reaping Eye** from **Nikta**, the Great Owl and Shepherd of the Seasons.

And in that moment, the balance broke.

Now, **Nikta** can only watch over the land with a single, unblinking **Sowing Eye**. The cycle of growth and decay is gone. The world is stuck in a state of eternal spring.

You can feel it in the air, a sticky warmth that never fades. The vines of the **Witherwild** choke the paths and strangle the rivers. The trees twist and coil into monstrous hunters. The very earth you walk on has become a hungry, verdant thing, swallowing everything in its path.

The walls of **Haven** may have kept out the gods, but they could not stop the vengeance of a broken land. And now, at the border of this eternal spring, your story begins."

## Purpose's Vision of Broken Wings

The world around you seems to blur, the sounds of the camp fading into a low, echoing hum. You feel a presence, ancient and mournful, settling over you like a cold shroud. The light shifts, and the world is no longer what it was. You stand not in the present, but in a memory—a waking vision of a time not long past.

**Please describe to me the general layout of your clan's village which lies to the south of the greater vicinity known as Keener's Pike.**

You are a young giant again, your hands clutched tightly at your mother's cloak as she weeps. Your father stands tall, defiant, his shoulders stooped under the weight of injustice. Before you, a crowd of your kin. The High Priest's voice booms across the village square, a sentence of exile. Your family's name, **Purpose**, is stripped from you.

**What is the name of the High Priest who is yelling out to the crowd, to your dismay?**

The High Priest raises his hands, silencing the crowd. His voice, a soothing balm, cuts through the tension. "My people," he begins, his gaze sweeping over the crowd, "look at the sickness that has come to our land. We have prayed, we have fasted, and we have waited for **Nikta** to restore the balance. But she has not. She has turned her eyes away from us, and so we must look to a new path. The **balance** this family clings to is a relic of a time that is past, a cage of decay that will only bring us ruin!" He turns to you, his face a mask of disappointment. "And you, young one... you are **Purpose** no longer. A hollow name for a hollow life."

The vision shifts. Shame, sorrow, and a simmering rage fill you, a small, burning ember of righteous fury that quickly grows into a roaring inferno. It whispers a new word to you, a new name, one that would define your path forward.

Days, then weeks, then months pass in a flash of cold wind and hungry nights. The vision shifts, and you are no longer the same. Your body has grown, hardened by hardship. The whisper of **Vengeance** becomes a roar in your ears. You need to become strong, to learn the ways of the fight. You travel far, seeking a teacher who could forge you into the weapon you needed to be, until eventually hunger, thirst, and fatigue set in. When it seems you are at your rock bottom, a figure approaches.

**Describe this teacher figure's general build and what they look like.**

The vision focuses on a single place, a person. The training wasn't a long, slow lesson, but a brutal crash course born of desperation. The teacher was a hard and unforgiving taskmaster, but they understood your fury. Their final lesson was about transforming that rage into something more than just a weapon. They spoke of how your anger was a kind of fuel, but that fuel could either burn you to ash or give you the power to soar.

Then, at the end of your training, a miracle. In a fierce sparring match with your **trainer**, your blows seem to be finding purchase more so than ever, your axe denting into their armor. Your trainer has never shied away from bloodshed in your training, and even you have scars that have marked your tribulations on your road to vengeance. He barks out at you, "V, you have learned a great deal, but do you have what it takes to strike true, when the moment comes, or will you cower?"

**What do you say in return?**

"Then show me!" And suddenly the spar turns into what seems like a duel to the death. He begins to weave under your axe, striking you in your legs and starting to cut you down. You feel the pain set, your britches soaking with blood. You fall to your knees. As you wince in pain, before the thought of a countering blow, you look up and your master seems bigger than he ever was, like he was falling from the sky, and with a massive **WHAM**, he punches you in the face, and you feel the taste of your blood fill your mouth. "If you're going to hit me, then hit me!"

**What do you do?**

You trade blow after blow, strike after strike, parry after parry. It's almost as if you're fighting yourself. You can feel yourself gaining ground on him. Are you getting faster, or is he getting slower? With each strike you feel yourself somehow getting stronger, or are you getting lighter? The second you begin to question it, another killing strike flies by your face and you quickly dodge. The vision shifts one last time, to the mountaintop you now spar upon, a sacred place your trainer brought you to. As you both clash there, a fierce wind begins to whip around you. The sky, a bruised purple, seems to crackle with an ancient, divine energy. The vision rushes back in as you make a heavy strike down towards your trainer, and then everything slows down. Your trainer turns around and in a flash unfurls eight rainbow wings, towards you. But your axe is already swinging down, and you can't pull back now. The axe strikes true, as you chop off all four pairs of wings, and almost instantly a strange new sensation begins to form, an exquisite pain in your spine. You scream in agony, it's as if the bones in your entire body are breaking and reforming all at once. You feel the skin on your back grow tight with a pressure from within your body trying to force its way out, and you fall down on to all fours. The pressure becomes too much, and your vision begins to blur, color begins to fade, and just as everything is going white, it stops. Your breathing is incredibly heavy, and your vision begins to slowly return as you glance to your left, and see rainbow feathers, the same feathers to your right as well. A voice whispers, "Rise."

**What do you do?**

You feel the wind catch under them, a new weight to your body, a new freedom to your soul. They are a gift from Nikta herself—a sign that you have earned your new purpose. You are a champion of your goddess, and you must now return to fight for the balance she can no longer maintain on her own. You have earned her wings. And in your triumph you forget yourself, as you look back down your trainer is nowhere in sight.

The vision rushes forward once more, time blurring past like a river. You feel the grit of a well-worn road under your feet, the familiar scent of home on the breeze. You are an adult, strong and determined, and you are back. You approach the High Priest's home, the grand oak doors looming before you, just as you remember them from your last moments here. You stand there for a moment, the weight of a year's fury and determination in your heart. You feel the eyes of your community on you, on this single, crucial moment.

**What signal do you give to your clan that you are here to cleanse the name of your family and reclaim their honor?**

## A Glimpse of the Wild

The air is damp and cold, but you barely notice. The feeling of freedom in the woods is so intoxicating, so different from the suffocating order of the castle your family resides in. For years your father has told you stories of the wild land of Fanewick ,and the stories until eventually you had to see the land he described for yourself. Shortly after your 16th name-day you slipped away from the manicured gardens of **Haven** and into a place your father had called "Wood's End." That day your curiosity pulled your deeper and deeper into the wood until you happen upon a clearing. The trees here are old, their branches bowed low with age. In the center, a figure stands motionless, a wizened form that seems to be a part of the forest itself. They are a living extension of the moss on the trees and the roots in the ground. They are a part of the forest, and as you watch, they turn to face you.

**What does this person look like? Describe their general appearance, and one detail that makes them seem as though they have been a part of this forest forever.**

The figure introduces themself as **Stonebark**, and over the next year, you frequent this place. You slowly learn to listen to the whispers of the wind, to feel the life in the plants, and begin to practice the magic of the wild. Now a year older, a year wiser, and a year more rebellious. It is late at night, and you are alone in your room, the silence broken only by the tick of an old clock. The air here is so still, so suffocatingly quiet. You remember the teachings of your elder, **Stonebark**. Your hands tingle with an urge to create, to bring life into this sterile place. You take a small white flower from a vase on your desk and begin to whisper to it the way **Stonebark** taught you. Slowly, impossibly, the petals swell and shift, reforming into something new.

**What small animal did you shape from the blossoms?**

Just as your tiny creation finishes taking shape, a small, curious face peeks through your open window. It is the son of the your family's servants, a younger boy with wide, inquisitive eyes. He stares at the tiny magical creation you have made. You know you should make it disappear, but for a moment, you are caught in the joy of your little trick. The boy’s eyes are wide with wonder, and then, slowly, a grin spreads across his face. You think he understands. And then, without a word, he is gone.

Moments later, your mother's voice, sharp as a winter wind, cuts through your happy stupor. "What is this nonsense, child? What have you been doing?" Her face is a storm of fury and disappointment. She knows what you have been doing. She knows where you have been going. The servant's son told her everything. Her eyes land on your creation, and the magic shrivels and dies under her gaze. She knows what she must do to protect you from the world that she so desperately wants you to be safe from.

**What was the expression on your mother’s face in that moment? Was it fear? Rage? Something else? Describe the exact look you will never forget.**
