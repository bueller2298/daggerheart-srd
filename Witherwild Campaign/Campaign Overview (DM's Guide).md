[[Fanewick]] is a wild and untamed land, long avoided by outside forces. The woods are dark and twisting, filled with [[Faint Divinities]] who perform small miracles and services for its inhabitants, but are just as likely to lure travelers off narrow paths to their ruin. Seemingly harmless expanses of field hide bogs that engulf entire armies, consuming heavy artillery as quickly as it can cross the border. This wilderness fosters hardy people who are bold enough to raise families where others have not and strictly follow the unique rules that keep them safe. These [[Wicklings]] remained insulated from their neighbors’ wars until [[plague]] forced the people of [[Haven]] to desperate acts. [[Haven]] was once the most powerful force in the region; for centuries, the high stone walls into the capital bore the phrase [[“The Godless Gate.”]] While the original meaning has been lost to common knowledge, some dusty tomes and ancient records state that the founders of [[Haven]] wished to be free of the influence of the [[Faint Divinities]] that dominated the surrounding regions. They hatched a plan to kill one of the mightiest of these deities, known as [[Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid]]. While their exact method of deicide is forgotten, their victory ensured [[Haven]]’s dominance in the region for centuries to come. They made their home behind his remains, which became the mighty walls that [[Haven]] is known for. But [[Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid]] would have his revenge. As the [[Havenites]] carved through his stone body, the fine dust left behind settled into the surrounding earth. There was a time of prosperity over many centuries while the scales of the god remained undisturbed. But progress is its own pressure. The growing population demanded increased productivity, and as farmers tilled deeper soil and miners hacked into hidden stone, the ancient stone dust rose to the surface. The same walls that brought the city security became the crucible that incubated a virulent plague.

Over the last two years, over half of [[Haven]]’s populace fell to a disease known as the [[Serpent’s Sickness]]. First, victims cough up dust. Soon after, their skin breaks out in a scaling rash. Finally, their body hardens—first the flesh, bones, and soft tissue, spreading until, finally, their organs ossify. Once within the organs, "[[Serpent’s Sickness|the serpent]]" moves so quickly that sufferers petrify where they stand, filling [[Haven]] with statues of victims in their last moments of agony. The [[Archmage Phylax|High Magus of Haven]], [[Archmage Phylax]], discovered a rare red flower called the [[crimson lady’s veil]] that could cure the [[Serpent’s Sickness]]. These buds grow prolifically across [[Fanewick]] in the spring—but for every ten thousand of the common white-petaled blossoms, only one red flower blooms. Desperate to save their people from the plague, [[Haven]] invaded [[Fanewick]] to amass the scarce red buds. Their forces plunged into the deep wood and, under the guidance of [[Archmage Phylax]], plucked out the [[Reaping Eye]] from the most powerful [[Faint Divinity]] that protected the land: [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons]]. The [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Shepherd]] kept [[Fanewick]] in balance by turning her eyes upon the land, first for ripening, then ruination. Thus [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Nikta]] maintained the cycle of seasons—of growth and decay, of death and rebirth. With her [[Reaping Eye]] removed, [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Nikta]] can only watch over [[Fanewick]] with the [[Sowing Eye]], forcing the land into everlasting spring. In the year since, [[Haven]] has conquered the bogs, turning them into fields to harvest red flowers. The endless growth that once seemed like a gift quickly evolved into a scourge known as the [[Witherwild]]—[[Fanewick]]’s flora and fauna flourished, unchecked and uncontrolled. Animals swell to massive size; trees warp, twist, and begin to hunt people; and vines creep along the forest floor, strangling all they touch. This explosive growth is unconquerable and unrelenting, with no force able to stop the burgeoning verdance for long. Prior to the [[Serpent’s Sickness]] and the [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Shepherd]]’s endless growth, your party lived a peaceful life in [[Fanewick]] or a life of toil and conquest in [[Haven]]. But when the danger demands a response, even the unprepared—and unwilling—must make a stand.
