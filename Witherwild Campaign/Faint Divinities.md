Gods in this land aren’t ethereal concepts that exist in another  realm; instead, they wander the land as incarnate beings,  residing in both the natural world as well as within homes and  small villages. As such, they’re generally present in Wicklings’  lives. Many communities, and some larger families, even have  their own small god or tutelary spirit who watches over them.  Belief and worship take on a different meaning in [[Fanewick]]—  there is a constant push and pull between the goals of people  and their deific neighbors. The gods must curry worship from  mortals, often by performing small miracles, acts of service,  or by testing their resolve with tricks and curses. Mortals  rely on the small blessings from the gods to keep them safe  when traveling and working in [[Fanewick]]. The most powerful  and widely acknowledged Faint Divinity is the [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Shepherd]] of  Seasons, [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Nikta]], as the loss of her eye had the most recent and  visible impact on everyone in [[Fanewick]].  Fanewick’s various divinities each have their own opinion  concerning the [[Witherwild]] corruption. While some enjoy  nature’s newfound dominance, many of the lesser deities are  wary of how out of balance [[Fanewick]] has become. While their  behavior and motives may be inscrutable, these deities are  more accessible than gods who watch from on high.
