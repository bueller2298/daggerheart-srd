 [[Haven]]’s beleaguered spymaster, [[Kreil Dirn]] (he/him), is not  a popular person in [[Haven]]. He is responsible for rooting out  insurgents, stopping schemes before they have a chance to  start, and keeping a close watch on [[Haven]]’s internal activities.  [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] has never agreed—at least not openly—with [[Archmage Phylax]]’s (they/them) decision to steal the [[Reaping Eye]], and  the consequences they’ve all paid for that decision have been  grimly vindicating.  Recently, [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] uncovered the [[Fanewraith]]’s plot and is horrified  by the possibility of her success. Knowing he can’t send a  troop of [[Haven]] soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and  stop the [[Fanewraith]] from stealing the [[Sowing Eye]], [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] uses  his vast network of informants and spies to find a group of  adventurers who can bring the [[Fanewraith]] to swift justice.  The party is sent an invitation from [[Haven]] to meet with [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]].
