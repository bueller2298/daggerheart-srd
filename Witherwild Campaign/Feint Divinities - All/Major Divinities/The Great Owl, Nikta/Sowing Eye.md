The sowing eye refers to one of the two extremely powerful eyeballs of [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Nikta]]. It is one half of the whole, the yin to the yang, so to speak. The sowing eye remains with [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Nikta]] while it's counterpart, the [[Reaping Eye]] has been taken by the [[Haven]] forces. With the Sowing Eye remaining intact and it's counterpart no longer present, Fanewick has fallen into an everlasting spring. Sow means "plant by scattering it on or in the ground". As a result of this the [[Witherwild]] runs rampant through Fanewick. This eye represents growth, rebirth, abundance.
