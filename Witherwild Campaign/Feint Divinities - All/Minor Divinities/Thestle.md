A spirit of song and wind that fell to minor deicide at the hands of [[Rayvian Goldwind|Rayvian]] and his battalion during the beginning sieges of the bogs of Fanewick.

Their song can still be heard on the wind by [[Rayvian Goldwind|Rayvian]] at times reminding him of his shame, and led to him doffing his armor and fighting more as a minor protector of travelers and picking up odd jobs here and there.

Seeks no revenge on [[Rayvian Goldwind|Rayvian]]
