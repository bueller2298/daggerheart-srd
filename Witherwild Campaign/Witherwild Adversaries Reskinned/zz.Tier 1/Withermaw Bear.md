# WITHERMAW BEAR

***Tier 1 Bruiser***  
*A massive ursine creature with bark-like fur, its muzzle slick with sap and ichor. Each breath smells faintly of decay, as though the forest itself exhales through it.*  
**Motives & Tactics:** Defend territory, crush intruders, protect corrupted dens

> **Difficulty:** 13 | **Thresholds:** 7/13 | **HP:** 6 | **Stress:** 3  
> **ATK:** +3 | **Claws and Bite:** Very Close | 1d12+2 phy  
> **Experience:** Territorial Instinct +2

## FEATURES

***Ferocious Charge - Action:*** Mark a Stress to rush toward a target within Close range and make an immediate standard attack. On a success, the target is knocked back and must succeed on a Strength Reaction Roll (13) or be knocked prone.  
*The ground quakes beneath its steps — a lumbering fury made flesh.*

***Rend and Roar - Action:*** Spend a Fear to make an attack against all targets within Melee range. Targets that fail their Reaction Roll (13) must mark 1 Stress as the bear’s corrupted bellow rattles their bones.  
*A roar that echoes through the bog, shaking leaves from trees and courage from hearts.*

***Instinctive Endurance - Reaction:*** When the Withermaw Bear marks a Stress, clear 1 HP as its body knits itself together with fibers of moss and muscle.  
*You watch as bark regrows where blood once flowed.*

Though not inherently evil, the Withermaw Bear is one of many Fanewick beasts changed by prolonged exposure to the [[Witherwild]]. Their dens are found near the edges of corrupted groves — where flowers bloom gray and the air hums with unseen spores.

*Formerly known as: Bear*
