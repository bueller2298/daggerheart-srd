## 🍂 FEATURES

**Veneer of Civility — Passive**  
When a PC rolls **14 or lower** on a Presence roll targeting the Courtier,  
they must mark **1 Stress** — the subtle pressure of pleasing authority digging into nerves.

**Obligated Influence — Passive**  
The Courtier attempts to position themselves between PCs and Haven officials.  
A PC who succeeds on a Presence Roll gains a temporary ally.  
A PC who fails **owes a small social favor**.

The Courtier deftly plants misinformation — the target has **disadvantage on their next social roll** trying to reveal truth.

## 🌱 Visual Notes  
- Fine clothing, but cuffs near wrists are **water-stained and fraying**  
- A faint **sweet floral scent** clings to them — not perfume… rot  
- Eyes slightly too wide, as if they’re afraid you’ll see the truth first
