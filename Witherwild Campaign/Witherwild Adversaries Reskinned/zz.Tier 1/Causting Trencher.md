## FEATURES

***Relentless (3) - Passive:*** The Trencher can be spotlighted up to three times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.  
*The corrupted pulse of the Witherwild thrums through its carapace, driving it ever forward, unceasing and unthinking.*

***Earth Eruption - Action:*** Mark a Stress to have the Trencher burst out of the ground. All creatures within Very Close range must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or be knocked over, making them Vulnerable until they next act.  
*The ground splits apart as the creature tears through, releasing a wave of acidic steam and clotted soil.*

***Spit Acid - Action:*** Make an attack against all targets in front of the Trencher within Close range. Targets the Trencher succeeds against take 2d6 physical damage and must mark an Armor Slot without receiving its benefits (they can still use armor to reduce the damage). If they can’t mark an Armor Slot, they must mark an additional HP and you gain a Fear.  
*The Trencher’s bile sprays in a wide arc, hissing as it eats through steel and bone, the scent of decay clinging to the air.*

***Acid Bath - Reaction:*** When the Trencher takes Severe damage, all creatures within Close range are bathed in its acidic blood, taking 1d10 physical damage. This splash covers the ground within Very Close range with blood, and all creatures other than the Trencher who move through it take 1d6 physical damage.  
*The Trencher’s blood boils upon contact with air, corroding everything it touches until only blackened soil remains.*

Once buried scavengers of Fanewick’s bogs, these insects have been warped by the slow seep of Witherwild corruption. Their tunnels steam with toxic breath, and the ground above them shifts like something alive. To the locals of [[Alula]], they are called *“The Hollow Movers”*—the sound of the land itself hungering.
