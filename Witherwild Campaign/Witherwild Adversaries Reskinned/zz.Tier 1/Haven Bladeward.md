# HAVEN BLADEWARD

***Tier 1 Standard***  
*A gleaming construct of Haven design — humanoid in shape, though its joints hiss with steam and its armor plates shift like overlapping petals of brass. A dull crimson light burns behind its visor.*  
**Motives & Tactics:** Protect, subdue, guard restricted areas

> **Difficulty:** 13 | **Thresholds:** 7/13 | **HP:** 5 | **Stress:** 3  
> **ATK:** +2 | **Arm-Mounted Blades:** Very Close | 1d10+3 phy  
> **Experience:** Formation Tactics +2

## FEATURES

***Parry Protocol — Reaction:*** When struck by a melee attack, mark a Stress to reduce the incoming damage by half as the Bladeward’s arm shifts into a defensive configuration.  
*The clang of metal meeting metal rings sharp through the mist.*

***Defensive Formation — Passive:*** When another Haven construct or soldier is within Close range, both gain +1 to their Defense rolls.  
*Their movements synchronize — a mechanical ballet born of code and discipline.*

***Suppressive Advance — Action:*** Spend a Fear to step into Very Close range of a target and make a standard attack. On a success, the target must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll (13) or be pushed back to Close range and become Vulnerable until their next action.  
*The construct’s blades whirl, forcing its foe into retreat beneath a storm of brass and sparks.*

***Failsafe Surge — Reaction:*** When reduced to 0 HP, the Bladeward’s internal core overloads. All creatures within Very Close range must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll (13) or take 1d8 physical damage from the resulting energy burst.  
*A hiss of steam, a red flash — and silence.*
