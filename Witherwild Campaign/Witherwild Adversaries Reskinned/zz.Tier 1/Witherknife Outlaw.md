### 🌿 FEATURES

**Bleeding Edge — Passive**  
Each time the Outlaw hits with their blade, the target marks **1 additional Stress** as black-veined cuts refuse to clot.

**Ambush From the Mire — Action**  
Mark **1 Stress** to burst from concealment (muck, roots, or foliage).  
All creatures within Very Close range must roll **Instinct (12)** or become **Vulnerable** until their next turn.

**Fanatic’s Surge — Reaction**  
When the Outlaw takes Severe damage, they gain **+2 to their next attack** and let out a shriek that echoes through the swamp — any nearby Witherknife allies gain **1 Fear**.
