## ⚔️ FEATURES

**Coordinated Assault — Passive**  
When another [[Haven]] soldier attacks the same target this turn, the Watcher gains **Advantage** on their next attack.

**Suppressive Fire — Action (1 Stress)**  
Targets within Close range must make a **Body Reaction (DC 12)** or become **Suppressed** — unable to advance until their next action.  
If a target fails critically, they drop prone, “ducking for cover.”

**Signal Flare — Reaction**  
When the Watcher drops below half HP, they fire a red flare into the air, calling nearby [[Haven]] reinforcements or alerting outposts.
