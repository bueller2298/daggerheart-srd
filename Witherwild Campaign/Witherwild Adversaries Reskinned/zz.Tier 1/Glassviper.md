## 🐍 FEATURES

**Mirrored Scales — Passive**  
The Glassviper bends light around its body.  
Creatures must pass a **Sense Reaction (DC 12)** to notice it before it strikes.  
On a failure, the Glassviper gains **Advantage** on its first attack this scene.

**Refracted Strike — Action**  
Make a standard attack.  
On a success:  
• Deal **2d6+2 physical damage**.  
• The target must make a **Body Reaction (DC 11)** or take **1d4 ongoing damage** as venom crystallizes beneath their skin, turning sweat and blood to tiny glass shards.  

**Splinter Coil — Reaction**  
When struck by a melee attack, the Glassviper sheds a flurry of sharp scales.  
The attacker takes **1d6 piercing damage**, and the Glassviper moves up to **Close range** without provoking attacks.

**Shimmer Vanish — Action (1 Stress)**  
The serpent momentarily refracts into the surrounding light.  
Until the start of its next turn, attacks against it have **Disadvantage**, and it can move through **Very Close terrain** (such as reeds or water) unhindered.
