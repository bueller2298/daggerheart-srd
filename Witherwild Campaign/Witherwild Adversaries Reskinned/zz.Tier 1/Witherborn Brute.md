## FEATURES

_**Slow — Passive:**_  
The Brute must prepare before acting. When spotlighted without a token, it **can’t act** — place a token.  
When spotlighted with a token, **remove it** — the Brute may act.

_**Rend Asunder — Action:**_  
Make a standard attack with **advantage** against a target the Brute has Restrained.  
On a success, the attack deals **direct** damage as thorned roots tear flesh.

_**Rip and Root — Reaction:**_  
When the Brute succeeds on a standard attack, **mark 1 Stress** to force the target to become **Restrained** by entangling vines and **mark 2 Stress** as creeping roots attempt to seed corruption.

> If a PC marks **Severe damage** from this attack, they gain **1 Wither token** as the plants attempt to claim them.

### Visual Notes for Flavor at the Table

- Bog-water drips from hollowed rib cavities
    
- White petals bud from fresh wounds
    
- Jaw hangs open, tangled with reeds
    
- Roots burst through fists, **hammering like piledrivers**
