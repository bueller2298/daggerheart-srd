# BOGGLASS SCORPION  
*formerly: Giant Scorpion*

***Tier 1 Ambusher***  
*A chitinous predator dwelling beneath the shallow waters of the bog. Its carapace glimmers like black glass, and its stinger hums with a low, resonant tone — the sound of venom thick as tar.*

> **Difficulty:** 12 | **Thresholds:** 8/14 | **HP:** 7 | **Stress:** 2

## FEATURES

***Burrow Ambush — Passive:***  
When undetected, the Boggless Scorpion gains **+3 Advantage** on its first attack roll after emerging.  
Creatures surprised by its attack must make an **Instinct Reaction (DC 12)** or begin the encounter **Prone**.

***Twin Pinchers — Action:***  
Attack two separate targets within **Very Close range**.  
On a success, each takes **1d8+2 physical damage**.  
If both attacks succeed, the Scorpion gains 1 **Fear** as it drags both prey inward.

***Bog Venom Sting — Action:***  
Make a stinger attack against a single target within **Close range**.  
On a hit, deal **2d8 physical damage** and force a **Body Reaction (DC 13)**.  
On a failure, the target is **Poisoned** — suffering **1d6 damage at the start of each of their turns** until they spend an action to purge the venom.  
Critical failure: the venom numbs their limbs, applying **Slowed** until cured.

***Reflective Carapace — Reaction:***  
When struck by a **ranged or magical attack**, roll a **d6**.  
On a **5–6**, the carapace refracts the energy harmlessly, reducing the incoming damage by half (round down).  
If reduced to 0 damage, the Scorpion gains 1 **Fear**.

> Then, the gleam of glass. Then, pain.”*
