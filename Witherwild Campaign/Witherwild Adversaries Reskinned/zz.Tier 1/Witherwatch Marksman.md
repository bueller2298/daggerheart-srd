# WITHERWATCH MARKSMAN

***Tier 1 Standard***  
*A disciplined archer stationed within the mists of Fanewick’s reclaimed bogs. Their armor is damp with moss, their eyes hollow from long exposure to the Witherwild’s creeping haze.*  
**Motives & Tactics:** Maintain order, patrol, suppress threats from the forest

> **Difficulty:** 12 | **Thresholds:** 6/12 | **HP:** 4 | **Stress:** 2  
> **ATK:** +2 | **Longbow:** Far | 1d10+2 phy  
> **Experience:** Trained Precision +2

## FEATURES

***Coordinated Volley - Passive:*** If another Marksman targets the same creature this round, add +2 to all attack rolls made against that target.  

*The air hums as multiple bowstrings loose in near-perfect unison, the sound more mechanical than human.*

***Suppressing Fire - Action:*** Spend a Fear to target a 15-foot area. All creatures within that space must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll (13) or take 1d8 physical damage and become Restrained behind cover until their next turn.  

*Arrows whistle past, pinning cloaks, sleeves, and skin alike to bark and board.*

***Withdraw - Reaction:*** When taking damage, the Marksman may mark a Stress to retreat one range band away, gaining Cover until the end of the round.  
*Discipline overrides panic; they melt into the fog, movement calculated, precise.*

Once proud defenders of the border, the Witherwatch Marksmen now serve Haven’s occupation forces. Few still believe in the cause — they patrol the edges of the bogs like wraiths in uniform, whispering the names of those who left with the [[Fanewraith]].

*Formerly known as: Archer Guard*
