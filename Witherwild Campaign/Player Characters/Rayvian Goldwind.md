Rayvian Goldwind was born the second son of house Goldwind, an ancient Havenite lineage known for its golden plated knights and silver-tongued politicians. His cousin Cairn Goldwind is the first son. The Goldwinds are proud and loyal to the High Arch Mages, faithful to the city’s ideal of secular strength, and supportive of the conquest of Fanewick.


Rayvian was raised for war. As a child, he paraded in polished armor too large for him. As a young man, he marched under banners stitched with golden windblown leaves, a symbol of glory in motion. When the “Serpents Sickness” struck, he led one of the first armed campaigns into the Fanewick wilds. His presence on the battlefield earned him the title “The Gilded Wall”. Few blows passed his shield and no orders were refused. He was a great soldier. 

  

But his victories came at a cost. Entire Wickling villages were razed under his watch. Temples of Divinities were torn down and burned. The most haunting moment came when he (under orders) personally struck down a “divine” creature the locals called “[[Thestle]]” (a spirit of song and wind). It died without resistance, and in the days that followed, the crops withered and the winds stopped blowing.

  

Rayvian began to see the truth. He wasn’t saving Haven… he was breaking Fanewick.

Unable to reconcile with his past and his conscious filled with guilt, Rayvian abandoned his title and duties.

  

He now follows his own orders as a protector for the people, Wicklings and Havenites alike. A shield for the voiceless, and a sword for the oppressed. 

  

He was once a great wall gilded in lies and now he’s just a stone… and that’ll do….

  

Although he jokes and messes about, he does have an emptiness about him, but there is still warmth in his eyes. Rayvian doesn’t just want to be forgiven. He wants to be better. He doesn’t seek punishment, but he doesn’t feel like he deserves anything good. He just deserves to be a simple stone… Hopefully he can learn to trust himself again and maybe even be a leader among men again!
