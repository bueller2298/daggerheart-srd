# PLAYER-FACING RECAP

### “At the Edge of the Witherwild”

When the Witherwild tree finally fell silent, it did not die.

The land recoiled — roots withdrawing, branches sagging — until the entire thing sank into the earth itself, leaving only a single vine that lashed out in parting defiance. Whatever you had fought was not a beast, but a **sentinel**, and it had learned from you.

The climb away from the tree was no safer. The mountain shifted beneath your hands. Stone swallowed flesh and released it again. Vines reached impossibly far. The land itself seemed awake — watching, waiting for missteps.

At last, battered and wary, you found solid rock high above the forest and made camp without fire, trusting stone and silence to keep you safe.

With dawn, you climbed again.

The alcove you reached was unmistakable — a hidden hollow carved into the mountainside. Inside, you found signs of life: a cold campfire, a pot of stew, and four bowls. Three lay spilled. One had been set down carefully.

No blood. No struggle. Just absence.

Deeper within, a small dwelling waited — a bed left unmade, belongings untouched, slippers by the bedside, and a stand meant for something now gone. Whoever lived here had not fled in terror.

They had left **on purpose**.

And as you stand within that quiet space now, you know two things for certain:

You are close.

And whatever you are following did not run.

If you want next, we can:

- Tighten the **player recap into a 60-second spoken intro**
    
- Flag **DM-only “truth vs assumption” notes** for the alcove
    
- Or roll directly into **the approaching presence** as the opening beat of the next session
    

Just tell me how you want to open.

## ACT I — THE NOISE (Opening Scene)

### What the players perceive

Start _small_ and _wrong_, not explosive.

- A sound that is **not aggressive**:
    
    - Roots grinding slowly, like a tree being uprooted by hand
        
    - Wet petals dragging across stone
        
    - Footsteps that stop when listened to
        
- The environment reacts **before** she appears:
    
    - Witherwild growth subtly **pulls inward**, not outward
        
    - Animals flee _past_ the party, not toward danger
        
    - The locket (if present) grows **warm**, not cold
        

Key tone note:  
This is not an ambush. This is an **arrival**.

---

### DM cues you can use

You don’t describe _her_ yet. You describe **what moves aside to make room**.

> “Whatever is coming isn’t forcing its way through the land. The land is… yielding.”

Let the players react, hide, prepare, or call out. None of that breaks the scene.

---

## ACT II — THE APPARITION REVEALS ITSELF

### How she appears

The Fanewraith apparition should not “manifest” theatrically.

Options you can choose from:

- She steps out from behind something the party already clocked
    
- She emerges _wearing_ a familiar silhouette (someone gathered)
    
- She is already standing somewhere when they turn around
    

Important:  
She does **not** rush. She does **not** threaten. She does **not** monologue.

---

### Her opening line (choose one tone)

Keep it short. Calm. Surgical.

Examples:

- “You’re early. That complicates things.”
    
- “I was hoping it would be you.”
    
- “Good. You haven’t broken it yet.”
    

She acknowledges them as _actors_, not obstacles.

---

## ACT III — WHAT SHE IS (WITHOUT A LORE DUMP)

This is where you must resist explaining her origins. Instead, let her define herself **by function**.

### What she will clearly state

Over the course of the conversation (not all at once), she should communicate:

1. **She is not Nikta**
    
    - “I am not balance. I am what remains when balance cannot finish its work.”
        
2. **Nikta is damaged beyond repair**
    
    - “The Eye is gone. You don’t lose something like that and continue unchanged.”
        
3. **The Witherwild is not a mistake**
    
    - “This is what happens when growth no longer knows when to stop dying.”
        
4. **Her plan is mercy, not conquest**
    
    - “I shorten the suffering. I do not prolong it.”
        

She never says she is _right_.  
She says she is **necessary**.

---

### What she avoids saying

She does **not**:

- Justify herself emotionally
    
- Ask for forgiveness
    
- Claim inevitability
    
- Claim prophecy
    

If pressed, she redirects to outcomes, not beliefs.

---

## ACT IV — THE MORAL PRESSURE POINT

This is the heart of the session.

### What she believes (and will defend)

- Restoring the Reaping and Sowing Eye is **impossible**
    
- Prolonging Nikta’s existence as-is causes **exponential harm**
    
- Ending Nikta is not murder, but **release**
    
- Every delay makes the final act worse
    

Key framing:

> “If I am wrong, then all I do is monstrous.  
> If I am right… then stopping me is.”

She lets that hang.

---

### How she tests the party

Not with riddles. With **direct questions**.

Examples:

- “If a wound will never close, how long do you let it bleed?”
    
- “Who decides when balance has failed?”
    
- “If Nikta asked you to end it… would you?”
    

She watches reactions closely. This is reconnaissance.

---

## ACT V — CONFLICT (OPTIONAL, CONTROLLED)

This encounter **can** turn violent, but it doesn’t have to.

### If combat happens

- She fights **decisively**
    
- She targets the most dangerous or emotionally relevant PC first
    
- She demonstrates power, then disengages
    
- She does **not** pursue a full wipe
    

The goal of combat here is **proof of capability**, not victory.

---

### If combat does not happen

She still _acts_:

- Manipulates the environment
    
- Takes something minor but symbolic
    
- Leaves behind a mark, phrase, or consequence
    
- Forces the party to react _after_ she’s gone
    

Either way, she exits on **her terms**.

---

## ACT VI — THE EXIT & REVELATION

Her departure should clarify stakes.

Before leaving, she gives **one concrete truth**:

Choose one:

- “You are already carrying a piece of what I need.”
    
- “Someone you trust has already been gathered.”
    
- “Nikta knows I’m coming.”
    

She does not explain which one. That’s future play.

---

## END-OF-SESSION STATE (What the Players Should Feel)

By the end of the session, the party should feel:

- The Fanewraith is **not random**
    
- Killing her may stop _this_, but not the problem
    
- Helping her may solve _one thing_ while breaking others
    
- Nikta is not a passive victim in this story
    
- Time matters
    

They should be arguing **strategy**, not lore.
