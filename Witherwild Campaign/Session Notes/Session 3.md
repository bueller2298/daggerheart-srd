In our last session, the final member of our now band of silent saviors was introduced. [[Khatari]], a female fairy druid, longed for the embrace of the wild described to her in stories by her loving father. After some time of successfully sneaking out and meeting an elder in the woods, **[[Stonebark]]**, her gallivanting came to an end when a young servant boy fulfilling his duties informed Khataris mother of the magic that she now wielded. Khataris mother in a fit of rage and disappointment banished [[Khatari]] from her household and dubbed her an embarrassment.

Meanwhile, our band of gentleman approached the walls of [[Haven]], the remains of [[Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid]] that lay as a physical barrier from Haven to the outside world, but in the past many years slowly sowed the curse that is now known as [[Serpent’s Sickness]]. As they approached [[Khatari]] wild-shaped into a small mouse and followed behind them as they made their way through the city with purpose. Statues littered the streets of Haven, people who had succumbed to the [[Serpent’s Sickness|plague]], frozen in their final moments of anguish. The four men and their follower approached a building with a small plaque inlaid with a magnifying glass over a scroll intersecting with a dagger dripping with blood, the sigil of [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]]. 

You all were greeted by the seeming wife of [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] and led to his study where he gave you a quest, and promised very little glory if any at all in return. He mentioned various pieces of information that seemingly hooked each one of you into the quest in your own ways. The quest starting with a small lead, a name, the [[Fanewraith]], a person forming a small but consequential coalition with the intention to end the rampant [[Witherwild]] by removing the [[Reaping Eye]] from [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Nikta]]. He gave you a location where you may begin your quest, [[Alula]].[[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] did not know how this plan would fare but feels that it isn't not the way forward. He informed you that the [[Sowing Eye]] lie in a vault deep beneath the city that at this point would be folly to attempt to reclaim. He also discovered [[Khatari]] and gave her very little choice but to join the gentleman in their quest. He gave the party a [[Box of Many Goods]], a bit of coin, and that is where we now pick up.

**Is there anything that you all would like to do before you head out?**

# 🌳 Whispers Beneath the Boughs

### Act I of the [[Fanewraith Arc]]

**Location:** [[Alula]] – the treetop village of [[Fanewick]]’s southern bogs  
**Session Length:** 2.5–3 hours  
**Party Level:** 1

---

## 🌿 Atmospheric Opening

As the party travels south from [[Haven]], the road narrows and gives way to wet earth. The scent of sweet rot thickens, mingled with a floral perfume that clings to everything — the ghost of [[Crimson Lady’s Veil]]. The trees grow wide and bowed, their roots rising from the bog like ribs.

The village of **[[Alula]]** reveals itself gradually: bridges strung between trees, wooden homes grown into living trunks, soft lanterns flickering like fireflies in mist.

> **Player Prompts:**  
> • “What about this place immediately reminds your character of home?”  
> • “And what about it unsettles you?”

---

## 🕯️ The Setting of [[Alula]]

|**Area**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**[[Root Market]]**|The base level of the village. Muddy paths and knee-high planks lead to tents selling reeds, spices, and dried white flowers. [[Haven]] banners hang limp in the damp air.|
|**[[Canopy Walk]]**|The upper village. Platforms woven between branches, connected by rope bridges and pulleys. The homes smell of sap and parchment.|
|**[[The Red Ark]]**|A great flat-bottomed research barge moored nearby. Its hull hums faintly at night. Only those with Haven writs are permitted aboard.|
|**[[Alulan Archival Atelier]]**|A hidden stairway in the upper canopy leads to this scholarly enclave. The air is colder here; ink and ozone scent the space.|
|**[[The Bloomfields]]**|Once wild, now regimented bog farms where Haven soldiers cultivate [[Crimson Lady’s Veil]]. Rows of pale white blossoms stretch endlessly under thin mist.|

---

## 🧭 Adventure Flow

### Scene 1 — **Arrival & Rumor**

**Tone:** Curious, tense  
**Purpose:** Establish [[Alula]] and allow free roleplay

A [[Haven]] patrol drags a villager through the market — accused of “sabotaging Veil production.” Locals watch silently.

**NPC:**

- **Corporal Lissandra Vale** (she/her, Human, [[Haven]] Officer)
    
    - _Motivation:_ Maintain order, though she’s uneasy about the occupation.
        
    - _Clue:_ If pressed kindly, she admits, _“That witch who called herself [[Fanewraith]] passed through here last week.”_
        

> **Player Prompt:**  
> “What rumor have you each heard of the [[Fanewraith]] before now — and who told it to you?”

---

### Scene 2 — **Exploration & Introductions**

**Tone:** Communal, investigative  
**Purpose:** Let players interact and shape tone

|**NPC**|**Location**|**Description**|**Hook**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Taren Mohr**(they/them, [[Faun]])|[[Root Market]]|Long-limbed, moss in their horns. Once worked the bog farms.|Knows that the red blossoms “refuse to bloom.”|
|**Ilenna Brack**(she/her, [[Dwarf]])|[[Canopy Walk]]|Repairs bridges, gruff but kind.|Offers lodging for the night. Knows which villagers vanished after the [[Fanewraith]]’s visit.|
|**Elden Forrow**(he/him, Human)|[[Alulan Archival Atelier]]|Nervous scribe who handled [[Flawsee]]’s feather inquiry.|Recognizes Flawsee and hints at missing correspondence.|

Signs of the [[Fanewraith]] remain:

- **White chalk sigils** drawn across floorboards.
    
- Locals whisper: “She promised to heal the land, but the flowers just turned gray.”
    

---

### Scene 3 — **The False Lead**  _(Mid-Session Breakpoint)_

**Tone:** Intrigue, slow dread  
**Purpose:** Reveal mystery and close the first act

The party finds the supposed **headquarters** of the [[Fanewraith]] — a derelict observation hut overlooking the bog. Inside:

- Half-burned journals, old wax seals, faint celestial ink.
    
- Notes on _communing with the [[Sowing Eye]]_ — desperate, not malicious.
    

> **Player Prompts:**  
> “What detail here suggests the [[Fanewraith]] might not be who you expected?”  
> “What object catches your eye that might be useful later?”

As they investigate, a **Withered remnant** stirs — perhaps a vine-wrapped spirit or sentient moss.  
Use this as a brief, descriptive encounter or tension release.

Afterward, they may rest in [[Alula]] before deciding next steps.

---

## 🌙 Closing Threads for Next Session

1. **Flawsee’s Lead:**  
    [[Elden Forrow]] discreetly gives Flawsee a sealed letter referencing “Oz’kan’s Blight” and _“the Isle of Twelve.”_
    
2. **Kreil’s Trail:**  
    A coded note in the hut mentions _“a crossing at dawn, south through the Rootpath Marsh.”_
    
3. **Phylax’s Interest:**  
    A [[Haven]] courier invites them to _“assist in observation of bog flora.”_ — thinly veiled conscription.

# 🌫️ Scene 3: The False Lead

### Act I — Whispers Beneath the Boughs

**Location:** [[Fanewraith’s Observation Hut]]  
**Type:** Exploration / Skill Scene / Optional Combat  
**Tone:** Intrigue, isolation, quiet dread

---

## 🌲 Arrival

The trail leads beyond the lower bog paths of [[Alula]], winding through half-sunken boardwalks toward a shallow rise of earth where mist gathers thick.

A narrow bridge of planks, worn to silver, crosses to a hut perched between two leaning trees — the supposed **headquarters** of the [[Fanewraith]].

When the party arrives, the area is unnervingly silent except for the steady drip of water from the canopy.

> _Ask the players:_  
> “What about this place feels recently abandoned?”  
> “What detail hints that whoever was here didn’t intend to stay gone for long?”

---

## 🛖 Inside the Hut

The observation hut is small but dense with strange detail.  
Let players investigate freely — reveal clues by **questioning and describing**, not rolls, unless it’s about danger or focus.

|**Object / Detail**|**Description**|**Notes**|
|---|---|---|
|**Half-burned Journals**|The cover reads: _“Communion and the Eye.”_ Several pages reference _“threads of sowing”_ and _“the waking root below.”_|Suggests the [[Fanewraith]] sought to _channel_ the [[Sowing Eye]] rather than steal from it.|
|**Wax-Sealed Drawings**|Circle diagrams of the [[Witherwild]], annotated in shimmering ink that glows faintly when exposed to light.|Anyone touching the ink feels a pulse beneath their skin — harmless, but eerie.|
|**Broken Glass Apparatus**|A cracked lens aimed toward the bog horizon. Under it: soil samples, some gray and still smoking faintly.|A clear sign of _Wither exposure_.|
|**Suspended Charm**|A woven branch sigil dangles from the ceiling. It’s a warding charm against corruption — but recently snapped.|If repaired (Simple Task, Hopeful tone), grants 1 temporary Hope to the party.|

> **Player Prompt:**  
> “Something here suggests the [[Fanewraith]] might not be who you expected. What is it?”  
> Let this personalize the Fanewraith’s myth through each player’s interpretation.

---

## 🕸️ The Withered Remnant

As the last of the journals are examined, a low creak echoes outside — like wood bending underwater.  
Something begins to _crawl up the supports of the hut_.

A **Withered Remnant** reveals itself — not a beast, but the bog itself rising.

---

### **Withered Remnant**

_Tier 1 Environmental Entity (Treat as Minion or Solo-lite)_

> **Appearance:** A tangle of vines, roots, and human bones, dripping with stagnant water and sporelight. Its “face” flickers between moss and memories — those who died harvesting the crimson flowers.  
> **Behavior:** Drawn by motion and memory; mimics voices of the dead.

**Stats (Narrative Level)**

- **Difficulty:** 13
    
- **Thresholds:** 7/13
    
- **HP:** 4
    
- **Stress:** 2
    
- **ATK:** +2 | _Grasping Roots_ | Very Close | 2d6+3 physical
    
- **Traits:** Withered, Corrupted Flora, Emotionally Resonant
    

**Features**

- **Echo of the Bog — Passive:** When damaged, whispers the memory of a villager’s final words. PCs must roll a simple **Instinct Reaction (12)** or gain 1 Wither token.
    
- **Entangling Growth — Action:** Mark 1 Stress to restrain a target within Very Close range. On failure to resist (Strength 12), they are held until freed.
    
- **Decay Pulse — Reaction:** When defeated, it bursts into spores. All within Melee range make an **Agility Reaction (12)** or take 1d6 physical damage and 1 Wither token.
    

**Narrative Use:**  
This encounter should _feel mournful, not monstrous_. It’s an echo of the land’s suffering — the Fanewraith’s absence leaving an imbalance.

---

## 🌌 Aftermath

Once the remnant is defeated or calmed:

- The mist clears slightly, revealing hundreds of white [[Crimson Lady’s Veil]] blooms surrounding the hut. Not one is red.
    
- Beneath a floorboard, the group finds a **folded letter**, water-stained and unsigned:
    

> _“I go now toward the marsh. The Eye is near, and its dream calls louder each day.  
> If I fail, the roots will remember me.”_

This letter ends the session on a melancholy note, pointing the party toward the next leg of their journey — **the Rootpath Marsh**.

---

## 🧩 Player-Driven Moments

Encourage collaboration before session’s end:

> • “What do you think the Fanewraith hoped to find here?”  
> • “What emotion lingers in this hut, and how does it affect your character?”  
> • “If you could leave one message behind like this letter, what would it say?”

Each answer can slightly shift the tone of Alula — hope, fear, regret — helping you set the emotional arc for the next session.

---

## 🕯️ GM Notes

- **Optional Combat:** If the tone feels too heavy, the Withered Remnant can instead manifest as a single writhing vine (2 HP) — meant for flavor, not challenge.
    
- **Thematic Goal:** Create a sense that the Fanewraith is not evil, but playing with powers beyond comprehension.
    
- **Session Pacing:**
    
    - Arrival & Exploration: 45–60 mins
        
    - Withered Encounter: 20–30 mins
        
    - Reflection / Rest Scene: 30 mins
