In our last session, the final member of our now band of silent saviors was introduced. [[Khatari]], a female fairy druid, longed for the embrace of the wild described to her in stories by her loving father. After some time of successfully sneaking out and meeting an elder in the woods, **[[Stonebark]]**, her gallivanting came to an end when a young servant boy fulfilling his duties informed Khataris mother of the magic that she now wielded. Khataris mother in a fit of rage and disappointment banished [[Khatari]] from her household and dubbed her an embarrassment.

Meanwhile, our band of gentleman approached the walls of [[Haven]], the remains of [[Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid]] that lay as a physical barrier from Haven to the outside world, but in the past many years slowly sowed the curse that is now known as [[Serpent’s Sickness]]. As they approached [[Khatari]] wild-shaped into a small mouse and followed behind them as they made their way through the city with purpose. Statues littered the streets of Haven, people who had succumbed to the [[Serpent’s Sickness|plague]], frozen in their final moments of anguish. The four men and their follower approached a building with a small plaque inlaid with a magnifying glass over a scroll intersecting with a dagger dripping with blood, the sigil of [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]]. 

You all were greeted by the seeming wife of [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] and led to his study where he gave you a quest, and promised very little glory if any at all in return. He mentioned various pieces of information that seemingly hooked each one of you into the quest in your own ways. The quest starting with a small lead, a name, the [[Fanewraith]], a person forming a small but consequential coalition with the intention to end the rampant [[Witherwild]] by removing the [[Reaping Eye]] from [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Nikta]]. He gave you a location where you may begin your quest, [[Alula]].[[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] did not know how this plan would fare but feels that it isn't not the way forward. He informed you that the [[Sowing Eye]] lie in a vault deep beneath the city that at this point would be folly to attempt to reclaim. He also discovered [[Khatari]] and gave her very little choice but to join the gentleman in their quest. He gave the party a [[Box of Many Goods]], a bit of coin, and that is where we now pick up.

**Is there anything that you all would like to do before you head out?**

# # 🌳 Whispers Beneath the Boughs

### Act I of the [[Fanewraith Arc]]

**Location:** [[Alula]] – the treetop village of [[Fanewick]]’s southern bogs  
**Session Length:** 2.5–3 hours  
**Party Level:** 1

---

## 🌿 Arrival at the Edge of the Bogs

The road south from [[Haven]] dissolves into mud and mist. The air thickens with the sweet, sickly perfume of [[Crimson Lady’s Veil]]. The bog’s surface glimmers faintly under shifting light — white blossoms floating like ghosts.

Eventually, a moss-covered marker rises from the mire — a wooden carving of a bird with spread wings. Faded letters read:

> **“Welcome to [[Alula]] — where the roots still remember.”**

As the group passes beneath it, the air feels heavy and muted, like entering a dream.

Wooden walkways rise gradually from the bog, forming a network of bridges and platforms between the trunks of great trees. Lanterns sway gently in the mist; distant voices murmur above.

> The treetop village of **[[Alula]]** rests among twenty ancient trees. Around one hundred souls call it home. [[Haven]] soldiers patrol the bridges below, while locals move quietly in the canopy — their gazes cautious, their hope worn thin.

## 🕯️ First Impressions

A figure greets the party at the entry platform —  
**[[Elder Mareth Elowen]]** _(she/her, Elf, age 214, Village Speaker)_.

She wears robes of woven moss and bark thread, a silver clasp shaped like a winged seed. Her voice is soft but carries an undeniable authority.

> “Travelers are rare these days. You’ve come through Haven’s checkpoints — that much I can see. I ask only this: speak gently here. We’ve lost enough to shouting.”

She offers to guide them briefly through Alula before returning to her home in the [[Canopy Walk]].

## 🌲 Overview of [[Alula]]

**[[Root Market]]** — At the bog’s base. Simple stalls sell reeds, herbs, and pale petals of [[Crimson Lady’s Veil]]. Soldiers trade rations here; locals avoid eye contact.

**[[Canopy Walk]]** — Rope bridges and wooden homes woven into the trees. The smell of sap, parchment, and incense lingers.

**[[Alulan Archival Atelier]]** — A hidden study built around an ancient oak, lit by pale blue candles. Knowledge seekers from across [[Fanewick]] once came here to study. It’s quieter now, but scholars still work in secret.

**[[The Bloomfields]]** — Vast bog farms cultivated by [[Haven]]. Endless rows of white flowers stretch into mist. The rare crimson blooms — the only known cure for [[Serpent’s Sickness]] — are harvested under strict watch.

**[[The Red Ark]]** — A moored barge that serves as a mobile laboratory for [[Haven]] researchers. It hums faintly with magitech power and reeks of alchemical vapor.

### **[[Fanewraith’s Observation Hut]]**

At the edge of the bog stands a small, vine-covered hut leaning over stagnant water. Lanterns hang dark, their oil long spent.

Inside:

- Scattered notes about “The [[Sowing Eye]]” — written not as conquest, but communication.
    
- A charm of woven branches, half-snapped — a ward against corruption.
    
- Journals that speak of a woman’s conviction to “pluck the curse before it grows roots.”
