Our band of gentleman approached the walls of [[Haven]], the remains of [[Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid]] that lay as a physical barrier from [[Haven]] to the outside world, but in the past many years slowly sowed the curse that is now known as [[Serpent’s Sickness]]. Statues littered the streets of [[Haven]], people who had succumbed to the [[Serpent’s Sickness|plague]], frozen in their final moments of anguish. The four men  approached a building with a small plaque inlaid with a magnifying glass over a scroll intersecting with a dagger dripping with blood, the sigil of [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]]. 

You all were greeted by the seeming wife of [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] and led to his study where he gave you a quest, and promised very little glory if any at all in return. He mentioned various pieces of information that seemingly hooked each one of you into the quest in your own ways. The quest starting with a small lead, a name, the [[Fanewraith]], a person forming a small but consequential coalition with the intention to end the rampant [[Witherwild]] by removing the [[Reaping Eye]] from [[The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons|Nikta]]. He gave you a location where you may begin your quest, [[Alula]]. [[Kreil Dirn|Kreil]] did not know how this plan would fare but feels that it isn't not the way forward. He informed you that the [[Sowing Eye]] lie in a vault deep beneath the city that at this point would be folly to attempt to reclaim. He gave the party a [[Box of Many Goods]], a bit of coin, and that is where we now pick up.

**Is there anything that you all would like to do before you head out?**

# 🌳 Act I: Whispers Beneath the Boughs
### Beginning of the [[Fanewraith Arc]]

**Location:** [[Wood’s End]] → [[Alula]]  
**Party Level:** 1  

---

## 🌲 Travel Interlude: Through [[Wood’s End]]

> **Read Aloud:**  
> The boglands whisper ahead as the last firm road gives way to moss and mist.  
> Wooden markers jut from the earth — worn, carved with the old [[Fanewick]] runes for “safe passage.” You pass the remnants of a border post, its roof half-collapsed under vines, the crimson banners of [[Haven]] hanging limp in the damp air.  
> Beyond the post lies [[Wood’s End]], a cluster of homes built among the roots of titanic trees. Lanterns hang low, their glow soft and amber, fighting the encroaching fog.  

[[Wood’s End]] serves as the last proper settlement before the deep bogs. It’s where [[Haven]] patrols thin out and nature begins to reclaim the path. A few locals still offer trade to travelers — bark-paper charms, preserved bogfruit, and cheap spirits meant to ward off the “root-sickness.”  

You might include a few quick, grounding moments of roleplay here:  

- A child offers to sell a handful of white [[Crimson Lady’s Veil]] blossoms, claiming, *“Red ones grow where the dead don’t rest.”*  
- A weary guard mutters that the swamp ahead “belongs to the ghosts of [[Fanewick]], not [[Haven]].”  
- A distant hum — the sound of the bog wind moving through hollow reeds — gives the sense that the land itself breathes.  

As the players leave [[Wood’s End]], mist thickens, muffling all sound but the creak of the boardwalks and the distant rhythm of dripping water. The air grows sweet and strange.

---

## 🌫️ Arrival at [[Alula]]

> **Read Aloud:**  
> The fog parts to reveal the treetop village of **[[Alula]]**, perched high among a circle of ancient trees whose roots drink from the silvered water below. Rope bridges sway in the wind, connecting wooden dwellings carved into living trunks.  
> Below, the marsh glows faintly — white blossoms stretching in every direction, the bloomfields of [[Crimson Lady’s Veil]]. [[Haven]] soldiers in polished leather wade among the plants, their reflections warping in the water as they move with mechanical precision.  
> Overhead, faint lights flicker through the canopy like patient fireflies.  
>  
> The air hums with quiet order, but beneath it lingers a sadness that’s hard to name.  

[[Alula]] is small — perhaps a hundred people live among ten to twenty great trees. Each structure is built into or upon the living wood, linked by suspended bridges and lifts made from woven vine. Below, boardwalks snake through the mist toward the bog farms and military outposts.  

---

## 🕯️ Exploring [[Alula]]

Allow the party to breathe here. The session’s first half should focus on atmosphere, curiosity, and conversation. The **[[Fanewraith]]** is the hook, but **[[Alula]]’s mood** is the story.

---

### 🪶 The Root Market

> **Read Aloud:**  
> At the base of the great trees, a series of planks and walkways form the Root Market. Mud-stained boots splash through shallow water as vendors call half-heartedly about reeds, tonics, and carved charms. [[Haven]] banners hang limp and damp.  
> A small group of soldiers oversees the trade, their expressions neither cruel nor kind — just tired.

Here, the players can gather early rumors and local tone.  

- **Taren Mohr (they/them, [[Faun]])**, a vendor with moss in their horns and an easy smile, sells small reed charms and speaks quietly of the [[Fanewraith]]:  
  *“She came through here… said the flowers would bloom red again if we stopped taking orders from [[Haven]]. Some believed her.”*  
  Taren is sympathetic but cautious — they can point the party toward others who met the [[Fanewraith]] personally.  

- A **[[Haven]] patrol** led by **Corporal Lissandra Vale (she/her, Human)** drags a villager toward the docks. She claims the person tampered with Veil roots, calling it “sabotage.”  
  If the party intervenes or observes, they may notice her hesitation. With empathy, she admits:  
  *“That witch—[[Fanewraith]]—passed through a week ago. Said she’d end this curse. Left us chasing rumors.”*



---

### 🌉 The Canopy Walk

> **Read Aloud:**  
> Rope bridges stretch between the boughs, swaying gently above a sea of white blossoms. From here, the bogs look endless — a pale field stitched with the black scars of [[Haven]]’s irrigation trenches. The scent is sweet, almost cloying.  

- **Ilenna Brack (she/her, [[Dwarf]])**, a bridgewright who maintains the canopy paths, offers lodging in her small home for the night.  
  She remembers those who left to follow the [[Fanewraith]] — “brave fools, all of them.”  
  If asked why she stayed: *“Someone has to keep the bridges standing, don’t they?”*  

> **Player Prompt:**  
> “From this height, what catches your character’s eye — something beautiful, or something they wish they hadn’t seen?”  

---

### 🪔 The Alulan Archival Atelier

> **Read Aloud:**  
> A narrow spiral stair rises through the canopy to a chamber lined with weathered tomes and parchment scrolls. Ink stains the floor like old blood. The symbol of an open eye — [[Alula]]’s mark of scholarship — adorns the entryway.  
> The scent of ozone and wax lingers here.  

Inside, **Elden Forrow (he/him, Human)**, a jittery scribe, maintains what remains of the Atelier’s records.  
He recognizes [[Flawsee L'Bougie|Flawsee]]immediately if present, though he’s nervous about being overheard.  
Elden can confirm the Atelier once corresponded with the [[Fanewraith]], exchanging letters on “soul mechanics and reclamation.”  

> He hesitates, then slides a folded letter across the table:  
> _“She wanted to know about feathers. Said she’d found one black as pitch that sang when touched. We never saw her again.”_  

He also mentions the [[Fanewraith]]’s observation hut — a small structure deeper in the bogs, used “for study of red-bloom variance.”  

---

## 🌧️ The Observation Hut

> **Read Aloud:**  
> Beyond the main bridges, a half-submerged boardwalk leads into the mist. The air grows heavy with decay, and even the white blossoms turn pale gray.  
> At the edge of sight stands a crooked hut perched atop two leaning trees — the [[Fanewraith]]’s supposed refuge. Its walls are etched with chalk sigils that drip faintly in the damp.  

Inside, the party finds remnants of her work:  
- Burned notes written in elegant hand: *“If the Eye sleeps, perhaps the root may dream for it.”*  
- A cracked lens, positioned toward the horizon.  
- A snapped warding charm — if repaired, it momentarily clears the mist.  

> **Player Prompt:**  
> “What small sign here makes you doubt the [[Fanewraith]] is a villain at all?”  

As the players examine the hut, the ground trembles slightly. Roots shift below the water — and from the murk rises something Withered.

---

### 🌿 Encounter: The Withered Remnant

> **Read Aloud:**  
> The water ripples outward as a shape rises from the depths — a tangle of roots, bone, and broken armor.  
> It moves like something half-remembered by the swamp, whispering in voices that don’t belong to it.  

**Tier:** 1 (Solo-lite)  
**Description:** A manifestation of the bog’s memory — those who died harvesting Veil blooms, reawakened by Wither corruption.  
It is mournful rather than malicious, lashing out only when threatened.  

**Suggested Mechanics:**  
Use Tier 1 Solo or Environmental stats. Its attacks restrain and decay; its defeat releases a burst of spores causing minor damage and one Wither token on failure (Agility 12).  

Once subdued, the mist eases. The surrounding Veil blooms regain faint white shimmer — none red.  

Beneath the floorboards, the group discovers a letter written in the same careful script:  

> _“I go now toward the marsh. The Eye calls louder each night.  
> If I fail, let the roots remember me.”_

---

## 🌙 Session Close

[[Alula]] quiets under rain as the session ends. The players may rest in Ilenna’s home or return to the Atelier.  
Whispers of the [[Fanewraith]] persist — part savior, part heretic.  

**Threads for Next Session:**  
- A coded mention of a *“crossing at dawn, south through the Rootpath Marsh.”*  
- [[Elden Forrow]]’s sealed note to [[Flawsee L'Bougie|Flawsee]]
-about “[[The Blighted Feather of Oz'kan|Oz’kan’s Blight]].”  
- A [[Haven]] courier requesting the party’s “assistance in observing the crimson bloomfields.”  

> **Player Reflection Prompts:**  
> • “What does this place remind your character of — home, loss, or something else?”  
> • “If the [[Fanewraith]] truly means to end the [[Witherwild]], what might it cost?”  

The story fades on mist, moonlight, and the faint hum of the bog —  
the [[Witherwild]] dreaming restlessly beneath their feet.

 # 🌳 Whispers Beneath the Boughs

### Act I of the [[Fanewraith Arc]]

**Location:** [[Alula]] – the treetop village of [[Fanewick]]’s southern bogs  
**Session Length:** 2.5–3 hours  
**Party Level:** 1

---

## 🌿 Arrival at the Edge of the Bogs

The road south from [[Haven]] dissolves into mud and mist. The air thickens with the sweet, sickly perfume of [[Crimson Lady’s Veil]]. The bog’s surface glimmers faintly under shifting light — white blossoms floating like ghosts.

Eventually, a moss-covered marker rises from the mire — a wooden carving of a bird with spread wings. Faded letters read:

> **“Welcome to [[Alula]] — where the roots still remember.”**

As the group passes beneath it, the air feels heavy and muted, like entering a dream.

Wooden walkways rise gradually from the bog, forming a network of bridges and platforms between the trunks of great trees. Lanterns sway gently in the mist; distant voices murmur above.

> The treetop village of **[[Alula]]** rests among twenty ancient trees. Around one hundred souls call it home. [[Haven]] soldiers patrol the bridges below, while locals move quietly in the canopy — their gazes cautious, their hope worn thin.

---

## 🕯️ First Impressions

A figure greets the party at the entry platform —  
**[[Elder Mareth Elowen]]** _(she/her, Elf, age 214, Village Speaker)_.

She wears robes of woven moss and bark thread, a silver clasp shaped like a winged seed. Her voice is soft but carries an undeniable authority.

> “Travelers are rare these days. You’ve come through [[Haven]]’s checkpoints — that much I can see. I ask only this: speak gently here. We’ve lost enough to shouting.”

She offers to guide them briefly through [[Alula]] before returning to her home in the [[Canopy Walk]].

---

## 🌲 Overview of [[Alula]]

**[[Root Market]]** — At the bog’s base. Simple stalls sell reeds, herbs, and pale petals of [[Crimson Lady’s Veil]]. Soldiers trade rations here; locals avoid eye contact.

**[[Canopy Walk]]** — Rope bridges and wooden homes woven into the trees. The smell of sap, parchment, and incense lingers.

**[[Alulan Archival Atelier]]** — A hidden study built around an ancient oak, lit by pale blue candles. Knowledge seekers from across [[Fanewick]] once came here to study. It’s quieter now, but scholars still work in secret.

**[[The Bloomfields]]** — Vast bog farms cultivated by [[Haven]]. Endless rows of white flowers stretch into mist. The rare crimson blooms — the only known cure for [[Serpent’s Sickness]] — are harvested under strict watch.

**[[The Red Ark]]** — A moored barge that serves as a mobile laboratory for [[Haven]] researchers. It hums faintly with magitech power and reeks of alchemical vapor.
