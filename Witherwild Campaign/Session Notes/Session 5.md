As the adventurers make their way along the bottom of the moutainside, a trail that scales up the ridge eventually comes along, a steep climb up for about 1.5 hours eventually leads to a cutout in the mountain side, a small alcove, inside their is a humble campfire that is already put out, a small hut at the back of the alcove, as well as a space where it looks like a tent was packed up. The air smells of rosemary, meat, and broth. Near the campfire there are some bowls and spoons. ***If the players choose to scan this exterior of the actual hut, then they may find that 3 of the bowls are tipped over, spoons strewn on the ground, and one placed neatly with the spoon inside it, they may draw any conclusions they like.***

Within the observation hut, it is most likely that the adventurers will give it a thorough look through. At first glance, there is a small bed, no more than five feet tall, there are a pair of slippers that are rather large, there is a stand that looks like it holds some sort of instrument or weapon. There is a chair with a mirror and some jewelery. This place does seem to be a base of operation that is covert, so if they look carefully it will benefit them, if they ransack it, the [[Fanewraith]] will know when she gets back, success would be a stealth check of 15. Make sure to remember this for passage of time. As they carefully inspect the jewelry there is a locket necklace, a ring with an inset green gem, and set of fine gold filigreed bracelets, a plain looking golden ring, and laid out on the jewelry stand is a quill with ink and a stack of blank parchment. 
If the players choose to rifle through the jewelry or interact with the locket, an apparition of the [[Fanewraith]] appears outside the hut walking in.

This is not the real [[Fanewraith]] but is still tangible and can do harm. She walks in wordlessly, stands in the threshold of the door. Watches them pick through her hut.


The hut is small and utilitarian, a bedroll sits on a raised bed frame made of gathered teak wood. Beneath the bed is a small chest, within the chest is a beautiful red silk dress, a signet ring, and a letter.

"*You always did have a way with words, I shouldn't have been surprised. Children found a friend in you, elderly respected you, and your peers trusted in your words. Such a woman of the people deserves such a station, and thus the station is yours. It is the highest honor of mine life that I entrust this letter to be delivered to you,*"

The letter is ripped and cuts off there.
