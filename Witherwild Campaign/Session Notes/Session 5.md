Start at 7 fear

As the adventurers make their way along the bottom of the moutainside, a trail that scales up the ridge eventually comes along, a steep climb up for about 1.5 hours eventually leads to a cutout in the mountain side, a small alcove, inside their is a humble campfire that is already put out, a small hut at the back of the alcove, as well as a space where it looks like a tent was packed up. The air smells of rosemary, meat, and broth. Near the campfire there are some bowls and spoons. ***If the players choose to scan this exterior of the actual hut, then they may find that 3 of the bowls are tipped over, spoons strewn on the ground, and one placed neatly with the spoon inside it, they may draw any conclusions they like.***

Within the observation hut, it is most likely that the adventurers will give it a thorough look through. At first glance, there is a small bed, no more than five feet tall, there are a pair of slippers that are rather large, there is a stand that looks like it holds some sort of instrument or weapon. There is a chair with a mirror and some jewelry. This place does seem to be a base of operation that is covert, so if they look carefully it will benefit them, if they ransack it, the [[Fanewraith]] will know when she gets back, success would be a stealth check of 15. Make sure to remember this for passage of time. As they carefully inspect the jewelry there is a locket necklace, a ring with an inset green gem, and set of fine gold filigreed bracelets, a plain looking golden ring, and laid out on the jewelry stand is a quill with ink and a stack of blank parchment. 
If the players choose to rifle through the jewelry or interact with the locket, an apparition of the [[Fanewraith]] appears outside the hut walking in.

This is not the real [[Fanewraith]] but is still tangible and can do harm. She walks in wordlessly, stands in the threshold of the door. Watches them pick through her hut.


The hut is small and utilitarian, a bedroll sits on a raised bed frame made of gathered teak wood. Beneath the bed is a small chest, within the chest is a beautiful red silk dress, a signet ring, and a letter.

"*You always did have a way with words, I shouldn't have been surprised. Children found a friend in you, elderly respected you, and your peers trusted in your words. Such a woman of the people deserves such a station, and thus the station is yours. It is the highest honor of mine life that I entrust this letter to be delivered to you,*"

The letter is ripped and cuts off there.

Ended with 7 fear.

Session Summary DM FACING
# DM-FACING SUMMARY (CANONICAL)

### Session Summary — Based on Document One & Two

## 1. Aftermath of the Witherwild Tree

- The party defeated the **Witherwild tree guardian**, rendering it **dormant**, not destroyed.
    
- The land immediately around it stabilized, but the tree later **retracted entirely into the ground**, leaving only a single vine that briefly pursued the party.
    
- This confirmed:
    
    - The Witherwild reacts tactically
        
    - It can disengage and reposition
        
    - Destruction of a manifestation does not end the threat 
        
        Document One
        

## 2. Character Echoes & Internal Consequences

- **Find** experienced a powerful vision:
    
    - A past duel with a charismatic giant he once killed
        
    - The vision emphasized shame, Nikta’s influence, and the emergence of his wings
        
    - This was the first clear moment where Find _consciously wielded_ Nikta’s gift in combat
        
- **Flawsee** suffered a memory backlash:
    
    - A vision of an elven relative speaking silently
        
    - Purple, noxious smoke accompanied the memory
        
    - Flawsee took damage attempting to access it
        
    - This reinforces the idea that memory, curse, and magic are intertwined
        
- **Harlow** reflected on isolation vs unity:
    
    - Recognized that strength in this fight came from coordination, not brute force
        
    - Reinforced party cohesion as mechanically and narratively important 
        
        Document One
        

## 3. Ascent from the Tree

- The party chose **not** to linger near the dormant guardian.
    
- They began ascending the mountainside toward the suspected alcove.
    
- Environmental hazards included:
    
    - Illusory or unstable handholds
        
    - Rock that briefly swallowed part of Harlow’s body
        
    - A vine pursuing the party despite extreme vertical distance
        
- The party narrowly avoided being pulled back down the cliffside 
    
    Document One
    

## 4. Temporary Camp & Long Rest

- The party found a **rocky landing** roughly 400 feet up the mountain.
    
- The stone here was distinct from the earlier earth and appeared resistant to Witherwild intrusion.
    
- They chose to take a **long rest**:
    
    - Watches were established
        
    - No fire was lit to maintain stealth
        
    - The party healed and prepared for the next stage
        
- During watch, no immediate threats emerged, but the land remained tense and watchful 
    
    Document One
    

## 5. Dawn Ascent to the Alcove

- Using coordinated movement and limited flight, the party ascended further at dawn.
    
- They reached a **mountain alcove** — the location hinted at by prior information.
    
- The alcove opened into a cavern with signs of recent habitation 
    
    Document Two
    

## 6. The Campfire Scene

- Inside the cavern:
    
    - An unlit campfire
        
    - A pot of stew (cool, not spoiled, not poisoned)
        
    - **Four bowls total**:
        
        - Three tipped over
            
        - One placed carefully upright
            
- No signs of struggle.
    
- Packs and bedrolls present but not ransacked.
    
- This suggested:
    
    - A sudden departure
        
    - At least one person acting deliberately
        
    - No immediate violence 
        
        Document Two
        

## 7. The Inner Dwelling

- Deeper in the cavern, the party found a **constructed dwelling**:
    
    - Bed (recently used)
        
    - Vanity with drawers and mirror
        
    - Jewelry
        
    - Large humanoid slippers
        
    - A stand for a missing item (instrument or weapon)
        
    - A chest beneath the bed
        
- The space showed signs of **recent, orderly habitation**, not abandonment through panic.
    
- No alternate exits were found.
    
- One party member kept watch outside the dwelling while the others investigated 
    
    Document Two
    

## 8. Session End State

- The party is **inside the alcove**, mid-investigation.
    
- The fate of the missing individuals is unresolved.
    
- The environment continues to act with intention.
    
- The party is rested, alert, and aware that something powerful is shaping events ahead.
