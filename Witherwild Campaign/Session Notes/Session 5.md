Start at 7 fear

As the adventurers make their way along the bottom of the moutainside, a trail that scales up the ridge eventually comes along, a steep climb up for about 1.5 hours eventually leads to a cutout in the mountain side, a small alcove, inside their is a humble campfire that is already put out, a small hut at the back of the alcove, as well as a space where it looks like a tent was packed up. The air smells of rosemary, meat, and broth. Near the campfire there are some bowls and spoons. ***If the players choose to scan this exterior of the actual hut, then they may find that 3 of the bowls are tipped over, spoons strewn on the ground, and one placed neatly with the spoon inside it, they may draw any conclusions they like.***

Within the observation hut, it is most likely that the adventurers will give it a thorough look through. At first glance, there is a small bed, no more than five feet tall, there are a pair of slippers that are rather large, there is a stand that looks like it holds some sort of instrument or weapon. There is a chair with a mirror and some jewelry. This place does seem to be a base of operation that is covert, so if they look carefully it will benefit them, if they ransack it, the [[Fanewraith]] will know when she gets back, success would be a stealth check of 15. Make sure to remember this for passage of time. As they carefully inspect the jewelry there is a locket necklace, a ring with an inset green gem, and set of fine gold filigreed bracelets, a plain looking golden ring, and laid out on the jewelry stand is a quill with ink and a stack of blank parchment. 
If the players choose to rifle through the jewelry or interact with the locket, an apparition of the [[Fanewraith]] appears outside the hut walking in.

This is not the real [[Fanewraith]] but is still tangible and can do harm. She walks in wordlessly, stands in the threshold of the door. Watches them pick through her hut.


The hut is small and utilitarian, a bedroll sits on a raised bed frame made of gathered teak wood. Beneath the bed is a small chest, within the chest is a beautiful red silk dress, a signet ring, and a letter.

"*You always did have a way with words, I shouldn't have been surprised. Children found a friend in you, elderly respected you, and your peers trusted in your words. Such a woman of the people deserves such a station, and thus the station is yours. It is the highest honor of mine life that I entrust this letter to be delivered to you,*"

The letter is ripped and cuts off there.

Ended with 7 fear.

Session Summary DM FACING
# DM-FACING SUMMARY

### Last Session — Story Beats & Truths Revealed

## 1. Arrival in Alula & Political Context

- The party arrived in **Alula**, a treetop village under the quiet occupation of **Haven forces**.
    
- They met **Elder Mareth Elowen**, a gentle but perceptive figure who serves as both community anchor and diplomatic buffer with Haven.
    
- The **Alulin Archival Atelier** functions as Alula’s memory, record-keeper, and informal center of authority.
    

## 2. Revelation from Elden Forrow

- **Elden Forrow** revealed that the **Fanewraith** arrived in the region **approximately 12 days ago**.
    
- Shortly after her arrival, **residents began leaving** Alula — not violently taken, but _departing willingly_.
    
- Among the missing was **Elder Moskin**, a deeply rooted and respected figure.
    
- Elden provided **a sealed letter**, given with urgency and caution, to be opened only far from the village and its “listening branches.”
    

## 3. The Herbalist: Taren Mohr

- The party sought out **Taren Mohr**, Alula’s herbalist.
    
- Taren was defensive, suspicious, but ultimately cooperative.
    
- He confirmed that several people had left recently and provided **names and locations**, including a residence in the **East Trees** marked by the family name **Loon**.
    
- His behavior suggested fear, not complicity.
    

## 4. Investigation of the Loon Residence

- Under cover of night, the party infiltrated the **Loon home**.
    
- The house was **orderly but incomplete** — sentimental items were gone, not necessities.
    
- This strongly indicated **intentional departure**, not abduction.
    
- A **letter** was discovered:
    
    - It described a warm, charismatic encounter.
        
    - It invited the recipient to leave Alula willingly.
        
    - It referenced a contact named **Elena**.
        
    - It included the phrase:  
        **“Roots remember what the branches forget.”**
        
    - The writer would wait **no longer than one day** — implying proximity.
        

## 5. Environmental Threat: The Witherwild

- During aerial scouting, **Find** encountered **hostile, semi-sentient plant growth**.
    
- Vines reacted to proximity, indicating the **Witherwild is active and dangerous**, especially outside settled paths.
    
- This confirmed that the land itself is destabilizing.
    

## 6. Elena, the Bridgewarden

- At a local drinking counter, the party learned **Elena** serves as a **bridgewarden** on the western edge of Alula.
    
- When approached and given the phrase **“Roots remember what the branches forget,”** Elena’s demeanor changed instantly.
    
- She provided directions:
    
    - Travel **southwest along the ridge**
        
    - Ascend until reaching a **natural alcove**
        
    - “You’ll know when you find it.”
        
- This confirmed Elena as an **active intermediary**, not merely a messenger.
    

## 7. Journey Beyond Alula

- The party chose to **leave Alula at dawn**, avoiding travel at night.
    
- They crossed bogland dense with **Crimson Lady’s Veil**, reinforcing its unnatural spread.
    
- A skill-based travel sequence showed the land worsening the farther they went.
    
- They reached a **landmark tree** at the base of a cliff — with massive roots and withered branches.
    

## 8. Combat: Witherwild Guardian

- The tree animated violently, attacking with roots, branches, and vine clusters.
    
- The environment itself was the threat — not a creature, but a **corrupted natural force**.
    
- The party identified the **tree as the core**, not the vines.
    
- After a brutal fight, they destroyed the animating force.
    
- The Witherwild **receded**, but did not vanish — suggesting suppression, not cure.
    

## 9. Cliffhanger

- As the fight ended, **something else was approaching**.
    
- Not rushing.
    
- Not hiding.
    
- The session ended with the sense that the party had been **noticed**.
