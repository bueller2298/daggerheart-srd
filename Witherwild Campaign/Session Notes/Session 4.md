Last we gathered, our newly allied band left the crumbling security of Haven behind, slipping past streets lined with frozen figures — people caught mid-panic by the serpent sickness that grips the realm.

Kreil Dirn offered little and promised less:  
Find the **Fanewraith** — a figure who whispers in plural and recruits the hopeful to change the world by seizing the **Reaping Eye** of **Nikta**.

The journey west brought omens:  
A child handing a white bloom murmured of _red flowers_ blooming only where _the dead refuse to sleep._

In **Alula**, under the uneasy guard of Haven soldiers, the group met **Elder Mareth Elowen** — a gentle watcher who showed them the way to the **Alulan Archival Atelier**.

There, **Elden Forrow** revealed the truth:  
The Fanewraith arrived just **twelve days ago**…  
Spoke to **someone** here…  
And soon after, residents **vanished**.  
Including **Elder Mosking**, beloved pillar of the grove.

He urged caution, and pressed a secret letter into Flawsee’s hands —  
to be opened **only when far from the village’s listening branches.**

Then came the herbalist, **Taren Mohr** — wary, sharp-eyed, but helpful enough to provide names and direction:  
A family in the **east trees**, marked by **Loon**, their home now dark.

As daylight thins above the bog, plans form:  
One shadows the herbalist…  
One flies under cover of night…  
One seeks rumors from a cheerful gnome…  
All eyes turned toward an empty home where **answers** — or **danger** — await.
