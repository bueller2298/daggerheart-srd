Last we gathered, our newly allied band left the crumbling security of Haven behind, slipping past streets lined with frozen figures — people caught mid-panic by the serpent sickness that grips the realm.

Kreil Dirn offered little and promised less:  
Find the **Fanewraith** — a figure who whispers in plural and recruits the hopeful to change the world by seizing the **Reaping Eye** of **Nikta**.

The journey west brought omens:  
A child handing a white bloom murmured of _red flowers_ blooming only where _the dead refuse to sleep._

In **Alula**, under the uneasy guard of Haven soldiers, the group met **Elder Mareth Elowen** — a gentle watcher who showed them the way to the **Alulan Archival Atelier**.

There, **Elden Forrow** revealed the truth:  
The Fanewraith arrived just **twelve days ago**…  
Spoke to **someone** here…  
And soon after, residents **vanished**.  
Including **Elder Mosking**, beloved pillar of the grove.

He urged caution, and pressed a secret letter into Flawsee’s hands —  
to be opened **only when far from the village’s listening branches.**

Then came the herbalist, **Taren Mohr** — wary, sharp-eyed, but helpful enough to provide names and direction:  
A family in the **east trees**, marked by **Loon**, their home now dark.

As daylight thins above the bog, plans form:  
One shadows the herbalist…  
One flies under cover of night…  
One seeks rumors from a cheerful gnome…  
All eyes turned toward an empty home where **answers** — or **danger** — await

## Trailing Taren Mohr
Whoever decides to trail Taren Mohr can make a stealth roll to remain unseen and tail them. A stealth roll of 12 will allow a success. Taren is an honest herbalist and told the party legitimate information, this lead proves to be cold.

## Checking in on the Loon home
Whoever decides to make their way under cover of night to the Loon home will find a home that looks quaint enough. An inspection of 12 will reveal that the home looks as if someone left expediently, 

An inspection of 15 plus will reveal a small letter :
"I hope this letter finds you well. Meeting you proved to be most opportune. I can't thank you enough for such an amazing night of merriment and conversation, and thank you for letting me into your trust. I will make my way soon from Alula, but I invite you to travel with me, should you desire. If this proves to be within your wishes approach,  approach Illena, and speak: "Roots remember what the branches forget. She will tell you where I will wait for you for no longer than one day."
