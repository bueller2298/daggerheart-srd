### Recap Narration (DM)

When the Witherwild tree finally fell silent, it did not die.  
The land recoiled, roots withdrawing, branches sagging, until the entire thing sank into the earth itself, leaving only a single vine that lashed out in parting defiance. What you fought was not a beast, but a sentinel — and it had learned from you.

The climb away from the tree was no safer. The mountain shifted beneath your hands. Stone swallowed flesh and released it again. Vines reached impossibly far. The land itself seemed awake, watching, waiting for missteps.

At last, you found solid rock high above the forest and made camp without fire, trusting stone and silence to keep you safe.

With dawn, you climbed again.

The alcove you reached was unmistakable — a hidden hollow carved into the mountainside. Inside, you found signs of life: a cold campfire, a pot of stew, and four bowls. Three lay spilled. One had been set down carefully.

No blood. No struggle. Just absence.

Deeper within, a small dwelling awaited. A bed left unmade, belongings untouched, slippers by the bedside, and a stand meant for something now gone.

Whoever lived here had not fled in terror.  
They had left on purpose.

### Inside the Hut

**Flawsee and Find** searched within the hut.

Items discovered included:

- A ring with an insect-green gem
    
- A set of gold filigree bracelets
    
- A plain golden ring
    
- A locket
    

Inside a trunk, a **letter** was found. It read, in part:

> “You always did have a way with words.  
> Children found a friend in you, the elderly respected you, and your peers trusted in your words.  
> Such a woman of people deserves such a station.  
> And thus, the station is yours.  
> It is the highest honor of my life that I entrust this letter to be delivered to you—”

The letter ended abruptly.

### Outside the Hut — The Approach

**Harlow** stood guard at the threshold of the hut when he heard approaching footsteps — a light, rhythmic pattering echoing through the alcove.

The rising sun flooded the cave mouth, creating a blinding glare. Through the haze, Harlow saw a **silhouetted figure**approaching from roughly sixty feet away.

Harlow signaled the others: they were no longer alone.

**Find** stepped out, axe in hand, wings concealed beneath a poncho.

_Out-of-character housekeeping followed regarding Witherwild scars._

Find was confirmed to have gained a **permanent scar** from earlier Witherwild damage — a black-green, ichor-stained gash across his face.

---

### First Contact

The approaching footsteps stopped.

A voice called out, masculine in tone:

> “Hello? Who’s down there?”

Find answered loudly and clearly:

> “Roots remember what branches forget.”

The voice shifted.

> “And branches always seem to stretch toward something, don’t they?”

Multiple voices began to overlap — familiar, discordant.

A feminine voice finally spoke clearly:

> “You’re early. That complicates things.”

She asked who sent them.

After deliberation, the party named **Elena**, the bridge guardian.

The voice replied:

> “An insignificant cog, meant only to guide the machine.”

She continued:

> “If I am to gather those who would help my cause, I need little birds. Outlets. And she has sent them well.”

She asked whether the party would join her cause.

### The Fanewraith’s Purpose

The entity explained:

- **Fanewyck has fallen out of balance**
    
- **Nikta’s Reaping Eye was taken by Haven**
    
- Restoration is impossible
    
- Damage has already spread through the Witherwild
    

She said:

> “If you rip a painting in half and place it back together, is the damage undone?”

Her plan was not revenge, but mercy:

> “To take the other eye. Not out of malice, but to restore balance and give Nikta the mercy she longs for.”

She declared her intent to walk toward Nikta — with or without them.

---

### Escalation to Violence

Find stepped forward, declaring his willingness to give his axe.

The Fanewraith perceived his intent and restrained him with vines, remarking:

> “I thought you meant to give it willingly.”

She said:

> “If I am wrong, then all I do is monstrous.  
> But if I am right… then stopping me is.”

Multiple voices pleaded for peace.

Despite this, **Find broke free and attacked**, choosing violence.

---

### Combat Highlights

- The Fanewraith moved with supernatural speed, applying pressure-point strikes rather than raw force.
    
- Find was **restrained** and temporarily **silenced**, unable to speak.
    
- The entity’s faces shifted rapidly:
    
    - A fearful mortal face
        
    - A pleading mortal face
        
    - A malicious mortal face
        
    - Several **non-mortal faces**, including:
        
        - A badger-like visage
            
        - A bug-like, antennaed face
            

A psychic, resonant attack emanated from the antennae, dealing severe damage and inflicting **restrained** and **vulnerable** conditions on multiple party members.

### The Apparition’s End

**Harlow** struck the entity decisively.

On impact, the Fanewraith’s form **burst into flower petals**, which fell lifelessly to the stone floor.

No body remained. Only petals.

---

### Communion with the Remains

Flawsee used magic to commune with the petals.

- Asking where **Nikta** was produced **warm affirmation**
    
- Pressing further produced cold resistance
    
- Using a map, the petals warmed over a **specific region**, narrowing Nikta’s location to a broad quadrant
    

The magic felt **will-based**, not studied — a gift rather than a formula.

---

### Aftermath

- The immediate threat passed
    
- Find retained a **withered handprint indentation** on his back where the Fanewraith struck — flesh slow to recover, unnaturally altered
    
- Healing magic reduced stress but did not remove the mark
    

Further reflection revealed:

- The Fanewraith appeared to be a **composite being**
    
- Some faces were mortal
    
- Others were **faint divinities**, not widely worshiped
    
- The entity was neither minor nor major, but something **assembled**
    

---

### End of Session

The party debated their next move.

Options identified:

- Seek **Nikta directly**, using the narrowed region
    
- Return to known archives for research on composite divinities
    

The party leaned toward **pressing forward**, believing time was critical.

The session ended with a plan forming — and the certainty that the Fanewraith’s appearance was only a beginning.
